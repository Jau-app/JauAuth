# Remote MCP Server Support - Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. Transport Abstraction Layer (`src/transport/`)
- **Transport Trait**: Unified interface for both local and remote servers
- **StdioTransport**: Wraps existing local process communication
- **SseTransport**: New implementation for HTTP/SSE remote servers

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Schema
Updated `BackendServer` struct to support both local and remote servers:
- Added `type` field (defaults to "local" for backward compatibility)
- Made `command` optional (required for local, not for remote)
- Added remote-specific fields: `url`, `auth`, `retry`, `tls`

### 3. Authentication Support
Multiple auth methods for remote servers:
- **Bearer Token**: Simple API key authentication
- **Basic Auth**: Username/password
- **OAuth**: Support for GitHub, Google, etc. (token flow)
- **Custom Headers**: Any custom authentication headers
- **mTLS**: Client certificate authentication

### 4. Robust Networking
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Connection pooling (via reqwest)
- TLS configuration with custom CA support
- Health check endpoints

## Example Configurations

### Local Server (Unchanged - Backward Compatible)
```json
{
  "id": "jaumemory",
  "name": "JauMemory",
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/path/to/server.js"],
  "env": { "KEY": "value" }
}
```

### Remote Server with Bearer Token
```json
{
  "id": "remote-api",
  "type": "remote",
  "name": "Remote API",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "token": "${API_TOKEN}"
  }
}
```

### Remote Server with OAuth
```json
{
  "id": "github-mcp",
  "type": "remote",
  "url": "https://github-mcp.workers.dev",
  "auth": {
    "type": "oauth",
    "provider": "github",
    "client_id": "${GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}",
    "client_secret": "${GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}",
    "scopes": ["repo", "user"]
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (To Complete MVP)
1. Update `backend_manager.rs` to use Transport trait
2. Modify router to handle both transport types
3. Test with a real remote MCP server
4. Update TypeScript MCP server to handle remote configs

### Future Enhancements
1. WebSocket transport for bidirectional communication
2. OAuth token refresh flows
3. Connection pooling optimizations
4. Metrics and monitoring
5. Circuit breaker for failing remotes

## Benefits
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing configs work unchanged
- **Secure by Default**: TLS verification enabled, auth required
- **Flexible**: Support for any auth method
- **Reliable**: Built-in retry and health checks
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new transport types

## For the Community Member
They can now configure their Discourse and HOS servers as either:
1. **Local** (if they have the code): Use absolute paths
2. **Remote** (recommended): Point to hosted URLs with auth

This solves their immediate issue while building a foundation for the growing ecosystem of remote MCP servers.
